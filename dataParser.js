Host-parasite relationship in which the parasite persists in the host while causing minimal harm - host becomes more resistant while pathogen becomes less virulent


capsid
protein coat surrounding a virus


RNA virus
A virus in which the genetic information is stored in the form of RNA (as opposed to DNA).


virus
A tiny, nonliving particle that invades and then reproduces inside a living cell. It steals host ATP, protein production, and nucleic acid replication machinery.

a disease communicable from animals to humans under natural conditions; also know as zoonosis


alternation of generations
A life cycle in which there a multicellular sporophyte (2n) that produces spores (1n) by meiosis. these spores grow into a multicellular gametophyte (1n) that makes haploid (1n) gametes (eggs and/or sperm) by mitosis. These gametes fuse to form a zygote (2n) that grows into a sporophyte (2n) - which completes the cycle

sporophyte
multi-cellular diploid (2n) phase of an organism. Makes haploid spores by meiosis.



antheridia

bryophyte
a general term for a group of seedless nonvascular plants (e.g. mosses, liverworts, or hornworts)


double fertilization
process where the pollen tube discharges two sperm into the embryo sac. Sperm #1 joins with egg to become a zygote (2n), sperm #2 joins with 2 polar nuclei to become triploid (3n) endosperm. 



fruit
The ripened/enlarged ovary of an angiosperm that surrounds seed(s). Often used for protection and dispersal 



gymnosperms
Seed plant that produces seeds without endosperm, flowers, or fruit. "naked seed plant"



lignin
substance in vascular plants that makes cell walls rigid (this is what enables trees to get so tall)


mitosis
cell division in which the nucleus divides into nuclei containing the same number of chromosomes. The 2 resulting daughter cells are identical to each other and the original cell. 



primary producer
An autotroph, usually a photosynthetic organism that makes carbon available to consumers (herbivores and the carnivores that eat them) 



sporopollenin
compound that protects plants in a harsh terrestrial environment - coats spores and pollen

dimorphic fungi
may grow as hyphae or yeast - these fungi are often associated with disease in humans


extracellular digestion
system where mycelium cells will secrete digestive enzymes from cells; enzymes chemically breakdown organic matter outside hyphae cells. (fungi are heterotrophs, so they need to eat some way!)
